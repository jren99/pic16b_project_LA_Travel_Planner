    "Using this code, we can create an interactive route visualization using Geopy, Polyline, and Folium. \n",
    "\n",
    "Originally in our project proposal we said we would use the Google Maps API, but through experimentation it proved to be difficult to work with. You can obtain an API key from Google, but a lot of features cannot be accessed unless you provide billing information to Google. If you provide billing information, there is a free version you can use, but you have a limited number of geocode requests you can make. Requests over that threshold will charge you using your billing information. That's not something that I think we want to deal with for a school project, so I tried to find some alternate methods."

We will use geocoding to transform the addresses of our hotel/attraction locations (obtained from webscraping) into longitude/latitude coordinates (as far as I know, TripAdvisor doesn't provide coordinates).\n",

    "Something I noticed about OSM is that not all addresses work. For example, the address for the Getty Center provided by TripAdvisor is *1200 Getty Center Dr N Sepulveda Blvd & Getty Center Dr, Los Angeles, CA*. However, if you take this address and plug it into OSM's website, you will get no results. This causes problems for the geocoder, and you will not get the location. For this example, I simplified the address for the Getty Center as *1200 Getty Center, Los Angeles*, but for the long term we will have to find some workaround that can apply to all addresses. I think the solution might be some combination of regex and try/except blocks."
